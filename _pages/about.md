I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Panlong Yang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=sst3cxoAAAAJ) and Prof. [Xiang-Yang Li](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=JURtNb0AAAAJ)(ACM/IEEE Fellow) at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). I have obtained a Ph.D. degree and am going to join The University of Hong Kong (HKU) as a postdoctoral researcher, working closely with Professor [Chenshu Wu](https://cswu.me/).​ My research interest is wireless sensing.
